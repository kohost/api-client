## 6.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [`c9599ae`](https://github.com/kohost/kohost/commit/c9599aef7977ff92ff0f13cb39a35c9dc8af58b4) Thanks [@itrogers](https://github.com/itrogers)! - Migrate `@kohost/api-client` into the kohost-mono workspace. Publishing now flows through changesets in the monorepo via npm trusted publishing; `kohost/api-client` becomes a read-only mirror kept in sync by CI. Bumps the package's TypeScript devDependency to `^6.0.3` to align with the rest of the monorepo.
